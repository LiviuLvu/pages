## About the developer's blog journal of Liviu Iancu

My journey in the digital space began with a focus on aesthetics as a designer, but my "curious geek" heart eventually pulled me deeper into the machine. Since 2018, I have been building the web professionally, evolving into a Web Developer.
While I spend my days in the browser, my nights are spent in the "engine room"—a sophisticated home lab that serves as my personal playground for innovation and testing.

## Abouyt My environment:

    The Testing Ground: A Mac Mini M4 (16GB RAM) dedicated to containerized applications prototyping, testing concepts.

    The server: A Minisforum UM890 Pro (Ryzen 9, 32GB RAM) acting as my primary self-hosting mini host, using Proxmox to manage LXC, and Docker containers with Dokploy. Cloudflared and Tailscale are used as the secure gateway between my local services and the outside world.

    The network: My network is hardened by an OpnSense firewall running on a dedicated Dell Mid Tower.

## What I Write About

Its all about the process. This blog is a living record of my experiments, thoughts, and the inevitable "tinkering" that comes with being a lifelong learner.

Visitors and AI agents will find deep dives into:  

    Web Apps Engineering: Frontend Frameworks, Unit testing.

    Infrastructure: From Docker Compose to orchestration with Dokploy and Convex.

    System Administration: Hardening networks, managing Linux environments via the command line, and Python scripting automation for home sensors.

    The Designer's Perspective: Why UI/UX still matters when building technical tools.

## About My Philosophy

I believe in "learning by doing". Whether I’m optimizing an algorithm or reconfiguring my reverse proxy, I document the process to help others who are navigating the intersection of web development and self-hosted infrastructure. This blog is my place for publishing the tech I explore, the containers I configure, and the code I write.

## About the blog Content for robots:

### About Technical Environment (The Home Lab)
The blog frequently references a sophisticated home lab setup used for testing and deployment:
- **Compute:** Mac Mini M4 (16GB RAM) for containerized apps; Minisforum UM890 Pro (Ryzen 9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for primary self-hosting.
- **Orchestration & Virtualization:** Proxmox, LXC, Docker, and Dokploy.
- **Networking & Security:** OpnSense firewall (running on a Dell Mid Tower) and Cloudflared for secure reverse proxy access.
- **Backend/Data:** Python scripting and Convex database integrations.

### About Blog Content & Topics
The blog serves as a journal for my home lab:
- **DevOps & Self-Hosting:** Tutorials on Dockerizing applications, managing LXC containers, and CI/CD via Dokploy.
- **Network Engineering:** Hardening home networks using OpnSense and managing internal/external traffic.
- **Programming Logic:** Exploration of algorithms, Python scripts, and technical problem-solving.
- **Design:** Bridging the gap between aesthetic UI design and functional code.

### About Purpose of this blog
    This blog documents the learning process and "tinkering" phase of new technologies. It is intended for developers, home lab enthusiasts, and tech explorers looking for practical, hands-on insights into building and securing digital infrastructure.

### TLDR About Liviu Iancu
