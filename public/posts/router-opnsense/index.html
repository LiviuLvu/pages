I built my own firewall / router using a small form factor PC with OPNsense open source firewall router. The previous “normal” router is now only used as wireless access to OPNsense.\nWhy did I do it? Its incredibly useful, practical and fun to learn something I am very interested in: blue team, SOC analyst perspective and improving network security for my home.\nI would probably go a lot further than a router, but in summer time, in my living space, having many devices to experiment with networking can quickly turn into a dry sauna and a suspicious electrical bill.\nWhy would you do this? Below are some practical benefits running OPNsense on your home network. It vastly improves safety for anyone at home using the internet.\nYou have powerful control over all devices,\nControl who has access to the network, when and for how long,\nLimit insecure IOT devices access\nFilter traffic in and out of the network,\nBlock adds for all devices,\nBlock known malicious websites,\nAutomatically scan the network for potentially malicious behavior,\nReceive prioritized alerts via email,\nAnd more…\nA normal consumer router is no longer updated (patched for security) after 2 to 5 years. With OPNsense you have access to:\nRegular security updates for CVE's (common vulnerabilities and exposures), Features available in expensive commercial firewalls, Intrusion detection and prevention software like Suricata, Snort, Crowdsec, Zenarmour and many more. Read more about it at opnsense.org/about/about-opnsense\nThe amount of features you can run is only limited by your choice of hardware.\nWhat about the downsides? This is no walk in the park for someone with zero knowledge on IP addressing, subnets, firewall rules, DNS, network bridge and other networking notions. However I am also far from expert and learned a lot about networks along the way.\nThis setup is not a install and forget type of deal. You have to regularly:\ncheck for updates, check if any warnings popped up, sometimes a legitimate link might not work due to a false positive, ad-block lists can block legitimate links (I succeeded to block the mac os updates this way) A bit about the hardware. Initially I wanted a mini PC for small footprint, low power and low noise (this thing sits near my desk). Unfortunately it is very difficult to find parts for trusted mini PC brands, especially for what I needed: additional 4 port RJ45 network connections.\nSome mods I found were also very difficult to install.\nFun fact: some popular mini PC brands from china were shipped with malware preloaded from factory. Found this randomly when researching mini PC network upgrades.\nHardware requirements Mostly based on researching how to comfortably run intrusion detection and prevention software:\nMulti core CPU, low powered Have lots of storage for logs, min 250 Gb Minimum 8 gig RAM Have at least 4 nice RJ45 ethernet ports Run cool and quiet For the small budget assigned to this project, new hardware was out of the question, but found a good fit on the open market:\nA Dell Optiplex 5050 with 16Gb RAM, some 250GB ssd. Already had installed a 4 port network card, a nice i5-7400T CPU. Can easily be extended with RAM, more network cards or whatever else is compatible with the motherboard slots. The CPU type T is also a low power version perfectly suitable for running a PC 24-7.\nIt’s a bit overkill for my home lab, but the advantage of this is that it stays cool and quiet.\nHave you tried setting up your own firewall/router?
