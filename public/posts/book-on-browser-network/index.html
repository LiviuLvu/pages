Need to transfer many small pieces? Latency is priority. Need to send big files over same pipe others are transferring big files? Bandwidth is more important.\nThroughput indicates the level of successful packet delivery from one point on the network to another.\nLatency is the performance bottleneck for most websites\nFor the user, once a 300 millisecond delay threshold is exceeded, the interaction is often reported as “sluggish”.\nMost modern browsers, both desktop and mobile, can open up to six connections per host.\nThe fastest request is the one not made. Reduce transfer size, reuse cached content on client, reuse connections.\nThe rate with which a TCP connection can transfer data is often limited by the round-trip time between the receiver and sender.\nTCP is optimized for long-lived connections and bulk data transfers.\nUDP or Unreliable datagram protocol is a faster, simplified version of the TCP protocol. It does not provide any guarantee of message delivery, order delivery, state tracking and congestion control. UDP needs a lot of work to be optimized so it is more convenient to use WebRTC (real time communication).\nSSL (secure sockets layer) developed at Netscape to enable e-commerce transaction security on the web standardized as TLS.\nTLS (transport layer security) protocol designed to provide three essential services to all applications running above it: encryption, authentication, and data integrity\nThe best way to minimize both latency and computational overhead of setting up new connections is to optimize connection reuse.\nTo get the best security and performance guarantees it is critical that the site actually uses HTTPS to fetch all of its resources.\nIntermediaries between your source and destination “new protocols and extensions to HTTP, such as WebSocket, HTTP/2, and others, have to rely on establishing an HTTPS tunnel to bypass the intermediate proxies and provide a reliable deployment model: the encrypted tunnel obfuscates the data from all intermediaries.”\nOptimizing for mobile phones Phone’s radio component is often second in power consumption only to the screen.\nMinimize use of radio interface. Do not fire keepalive signals if not absolutely necessary, it can drain the battery very fast.\nDo not couple user interactions, user feedback, and network communication. If a network request is required, then initiate it in the background, and provide immediate UI feedback to acknowledge user input.\nSignal availability is very unpredictable and your app should be able to work offline.\nGroup your requests together and transfer as much as possible, then let the radio return to idle\nHTTP 1.1 features keep-alive connections, chunked encoding transfers, byte-range requests, additional caching mechanisms, transfer encoding, and request pipe-lining.\nHTTP 2 features many enhancements such as compression of HTTP header fields, request prioritization and server push, stream prioritization, request and response multiplexing.\nSince HTTP 2 works with streams it needs different optimizations techniques compared to HTTP 1. Chapter Optimizing Application Delivery offers a great list of optimizations for each.\nXHR used for async request. Not suitable for real time apps.\nSSE only server-to-client streaming of text-based UTF-8 real-time data. Binary data transfer is inefficient\nWebSocket allows bidirectional communication over the same TCP connection. Requires careful performance tuning. Real-time push can bring a big cost to mobile devices.\nWebRTC for Peer-to-peer audio and video streaming. Direct one to one communication can be simple, but it gets much more complicated between multiple peers.\nThe book is available online here.\nhttps://hpbn.co/\nOther tools and resources Measure performance with the Navigation Timing API. Offers metrics that are not accessible with dev tools.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API\nHigh Performance Networking in Google Chrome https://hpbn.co/chrome-networking\nIn conclusion There are many more useful lessons if you read the book. I found the WebRTC chapter to be the most difficult one to read because of all the details involving the optimizations of the UDP layer.\nIf you did not read this book yet, it is really worth the effort of going through the 400 pages. It was really interesting to read about how the mobile networks work, what the OSI model looks like for the web and what happens to your precious packets or datagrams in their journey across different environments.\nHave fun learning!\n",
